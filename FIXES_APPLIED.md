# üîß Fixes Applied to Crypto Trading Bot

## üö® Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Buy/Sell Token Issue - Only Buying, No Selling**
**Problem**: The strategy was only generating buy signals and not properly implementing sell logic for take profit/stop loss.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing exit signal generation for existing positions
- No integration between strategy signals and TP/SL execution
- Strategy was focused only on entry signals

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Added `generateExitSignal()` method to check for TP/SL conditions
- ‚úÖ Added `shouldExitPosition()` method to evaluate exit criteria
- ‚úÖ Added `generateEnhancedSignal()` method that considers existing positions
- ‚úÖ Integrated exit signal checking before entry signal generation
- ‚úÖ Added proper position state management and updates

### 2. **SOL Price Issue**
**Problem**: SOL token was not being handled properly on the Solana chain.

**Root Cause**:
- Incorrect chain name mapping for Solana (needs "mainnet" instead of "solana")
- Missing proper address handling for SOL token
- Inconsistent chain normalization across modules

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed Solana chain handling in `instruments.js`
- ‚úÖ Updated TP/SL module to properly handle Solana chain
- ‚úÖ Added special handling for SOL token on Solana
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling for price fetching failures
- ‚úÖ Added logging for successful instrument configuration

### 3. **Missing TP/SL Execution**
**Problem**: The TP/SL module existed but wasn't being called in the main trading loop.

**Root Cause**:
- TP/SL checking was not integrated into the main execution flow
- No automatic exit execution based on TP/SL conditions

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Integrated TP/SL checking into main trading loop
- ‚úÖ Added automatic exit execution when TP/SL conditions are met
- ‚úÖ Improved state management after exits
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for TP/SL operations

## üöÄ New Features Added

### Enhanced Signal Generation
- **Exit Signal Detection**: Automatically detects when positions should be closed
- **Position-Aware Trading**: Considers existing positions when generating new signals
- **Conservative Entry**: More conservative entry signals when positions already exist

### Improved Position Management
- **Real-time State Updates**: Position state is updated after every trade
- **Automatic TP/SL**: Takes profit and stops loss automatically
- **Chunked Selling**: Sells large positions in chunks to respect equity limits

### Better Error Handling
- **Price Fetching Resilience**: Continues operation even if some price fetches fail
- **Trade Execution Safety**: Proper error handling for all trade operations
- **State Persistence**: Automatic state saving after critical operations

   - Enhanced signal generation with position awareness
   - Improved risk management

2. **`dist/run-advanced.js`**
   - Integrated exit signal checking
   - Added proper trade execution logic
   - Integrated TP/SL checking

3. **`dist/lib/tpsl.js`**
   - Fixed Solana chain handling
   - Improved error handling
   - Better price fetching resilience

4. **`dist/lib/instruments.js`**
   - Fixed SOL token configuration
   - Improved Solana chain support
   - Better logging and error handling

5. **`dist/test-sol-price.js`** (New)
   - Test script to verify SOL price fetching
   - Validates instrument configuration
   - Tests all chain/symbol combinations

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test SOL Price Fix
```bash
cd dist
node test-sol-price.js
```

This will test:
- SOL price fetching on Solana
- WETH price fetching on Ethereum
- Instrument configuration
- Chain/symbol mapping

### Expected Output
```
üß™ Testing SOL price fetching...
‚úÖ SOL price on Solana: $XX.XX
‚úÖ WETH price on Ethereum: $XXXX.XX

üîß Instruments configuration:
  eth:WETH -> 0xC02aaa39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2
  solana:SOL -> So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112

üí∞ Testing price fetching for each instrument:
  ‚úÖ WETH on eth: $XXXX.XX
  ‚úÖ SOL on solana: $XX.XX
```

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### 1. **Entry Signal Generation**
- Strategy analyzes technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Generates buy/sell signals based on multiple confirmations
- Considers market regime (trending vs choppy)
- Applies volume confirmation

### 2. **Exit Signal Detection**
- Continuously monitors existing positions
- Checks TP/SL conditions based on ATR and configured multipliers
- Generates exit signals when conditions are met
- Prioritizes exit signals over entry signals

### 3. **Position Management**
- Tracks entry prices and quantities
- Updates trailing highs for trailing stops
- Manages portfolio heat (risk exposure)
- Applies position sizing based on Kelly Criterion

### 4. **Trade Execution**
- Executes trades through Recall API
- Updates position state after each trade
- Saves state to disk for persistence
- Handles errors gracefully

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
RECALL_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Optional
DRY_RUN=true                    # Set to false for live trading
PRICE_POLL_SEC=10              # Price polling interval
TP_BPS=100                     # Take profit in basis points (1% = 100)
SL_BPS=50                      # Stop loss in basis points (0.5% = 50)
USE_TRAILING=true              # Enable trailing stops
TRAIL_BPS=30                   # Trailing stop in basis points (0.3% = 30)
```

### Token Configuration
Each token in `config/tokens.json` has:
- **EMA periods**: Fast, slow, and trend EMAs
- **Risk management**: Stop loss, take profit, trailing stop multipliers
- **Position sizing**: Kelly Criterion, volatility-adjusted, or fixed
- **Technical indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands parameters

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Dry Run Mode**: Always test with `DRY_RUN=true` first
2. **Position Tracking**: The system now properly tracks and manages positions
3. **Risk Management**: TP/SL is now automatic and integrated
4. **Solana Support**: SOL token should now work correctly
5. **State Persistence**: Position state is automatically saved and restored

## üîç Monitoring

### Logs to Watch
- `[SYMBOL] BUY/SELL Signal`: New position entries
- `[SYMBOL] EXIT SIGNAL`: Position exits
- `[TP/SL]`: Take profit/stop loss executions
- `üî• Portfolio Heat`: Risk exposure monitoring

### State File
Check `data/state.json` for current positions and their status.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** with the test script
2. **Run in dry-run mode** to verify behavior
3. **Monitor logs** for proper signal generation
4. **Check TP/SL execution** with small positions
5. **Verify SOL price fetching** works correctly

The system should now properly:
- ‚úÖ Generate both buy and sell signals
- ‚úÖ Execute take profit and stop loss automatically
- ‚úÖ Handle SOL token on Solana correctly
- ‚úÖ Manage positions with proper state tracking
- ‚úÖ Apply risk management consistently
